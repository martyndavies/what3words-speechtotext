# What3Words, Nexmo & Azure Speech Demo

This repo contains the front end portion of a demo that shows how to achieve the following tasks:

- Connect a Nexmo number to Microsoft Azure via Websockets.
- Use the Azure Speech detection API to extract words and phrases from the incoming call.
- Push What3Words style phrases through to a live map that will move and zoom to the location spoken on the call.
